# TODO TAKEAWAY
 - there needs to be a way to get the default value of a store that's synchronous, the rest is
   async.
 - we need to filter updates by ID automatically, otherwise it's going to get busy
 - need to check that shouldComponentUpdate actually works
 - need a more complex example (tree editing for instance)
 - need to try wrappers for Backbone, Pouch
 - look into making the store come from the context, eventually
 - need to make sure we pass proper props to component
 - check that using $id to set the key actually works
 - need to list full set of events
 - look at how async props work because that's very close to what we want on reading
